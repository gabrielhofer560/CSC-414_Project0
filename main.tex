\section{Questions}
1. We wish to set all pixels that have a value of 10 or less to 0, to remove camera
sensor noise. However, our code is slow when run on a database with 1000
grayscale images.

(a) How could we speed it up? Please include your code.
% --- my answer ---

(b) What factor speedup would we receive over 1000 images? Please measure it
and include your code
% --- my answer ---

(c) Next, we wish to operate on color images. How does your speeded-up version
from 1 (a) change for color images? Please implement and measure it, report
the speed factor change, and include your code.
% --- my answer ---

\newpage
2. Suppose we wish to reduce the brightness of an image by editing the values in its
matrix. But, when trying to visualize the result, we see some “errors”.

(a) What is incorrect with this approach? How can it be fixed while maintaining
the same intended brightness reduction? Please include your code and result
image.
